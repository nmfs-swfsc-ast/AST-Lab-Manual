Acoustic data management is a complex endeavor. There are many moving parts, and can collect terabytes of data in a survey. This page outlines the AST data management efforts, including directory structures and storage locations for different types of data.

This page provides the in-the-weeds data management details, which will likely only be relevant for AST program members. Users looking for more general information about acoustic-trawl data products should go to the Accessing Our Data page.

### Data Archiving:

We use the NCEI Software [**CruisePack**](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/cruisepack) to archive acoustic data. CruisePack is a data packaging and metadata gathering software tool NCEI developed to simplify data submission preparation for cruise-based data. All AST acoustic survey data should be archived to the [NCEI Water Column Sonar Data Archive](https://registry.opendata.aws/ncei-wcsd-archive/) which is hosted on an Amazon Web Service (AWS) cloud database. [Here are AST procedures for archiving acoustic data to NCEI](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qEs_M0CJ_3slh8j4MNP3Ld-uo1m0KxAPJtTMvJn30bU/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.u2f00jdzppyd).
