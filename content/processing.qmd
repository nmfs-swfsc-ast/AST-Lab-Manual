We identify acoustic echos of schooling CPS using a semi-automated data processing algorithm implemented using Echoview software and in-house `Posit` code in the `estimATM` [repository](https://github.com/kstierhoff/estimATM). With Echoview we extract all non-seabed backscatter and backscatter of swim bladder fish. The Echoview filters and thresholds were based on a subsample of echoes from randomly selected CPS schools. The aim of the filter criteria is to retain at least 95% of the noise-free backscatter from CPS while rejecting at least 95% of the non-CPS backscatter.With the `estimATM` package in `extract_CPS_NASC.R`, we keep only the CPS backscatter and remove non-CPS backscatter.

### Echoview Processing Workflow

#### Data Averaging and Cleaning:

1.  Enter RAW EK80 acoustic data into Echoview and load ECS file.

2.  Match geometry of all Sv variables to the 38-kHz Sv. This aligns pings from all transducers to 38-kHz.

3.  Remove passive-mode pings and background noise:Estimate and subtract background noise using the background noise removal function (De Robertis and Higginbottom, 2007) in Echoview (Figs. 7b, e).

4.  Average the noise-free Sv echograms using non-overlapping 11-sample by 3-ping bins.

5.  Expand the averaged, noise-reduced Sv echograms with a 7 pixel x 7 pixel dilation.

#### Calculate Frequency Response:

6.  For each pixel, compute: Sv,200kHz − Sv,38kHz, Sv,120kHz − Sv,38kHz, and Sv,70kHz − Sv,38kHz;

7.  Create a Boolean echogram for Sv differences in the CPS range: −13.85 \< Sv,70kHz − Sv,38kHz \< 9.89 and − 13.5 \< Sv,120kHz − Sv,38kHz \< 9.37 and − 13.51 \< Sv,200kHz − Sv,38kHz \< 12.53

#### Calculate Standard Deviation:

8.  For 120 and 200 kHz, compute the squared difference between the noise-filtered Sv (Step 3) and averaged Sv (Step 4)

9.  Average the results using an 11-sample by 3-ping window to derive variance

10. Compute the square root to derive the 120- and 200-kHz standard deviations (σ120kHz and σ200kHz, respectively)

11. Expand the standard deviation echograms with a 7 pixel x 7 pixel dilation;

12. Create a Boolean echogram based on the standard deviations in the CPS range: σ120kHz \> -65 dB and σ200kHz \> -65 dB. Diffuse backscattering layers have low σ (Zwolinski et al., 2010) whereas fish schools have high σ. Intersect the two Boolean echograms to create an echogram with “TRUE” samples for candidate CPS schools and “FALSE” elsewhere. Mask the noise-reduced echograms using the CPS Boolean echogram (Figs. 7c, f );

#### ***Manual Processing in Echoview***

13. Create an integration-start line 5 m below the transducer (\~10 m depth);

14. Create an integration-stop line 3 m above the estimated seabed (Demer et al., 2009), or to the maximum logging range (e.g., 350 m), whichever is shallowest;

15. Set the minimum Sv threshold to -60 dB (corresponding to a density of approximately three 20-cm-long Pacific Sardine per 100 m3);

16. Integrate the volume backscattering coefficients (sV , m2 m-3) attributed to CPS over 5-m depths and averaged over 100-m distances;

17. Output the resulting nautical area scattering coefficients (sA; m2 nmi-2) and associated information from each transect and frequency to comma-delimited text (.csv) files.

### `Posit` Processing Workflow

`extract_CPS_NASC.R` is an R-based tool in the `estimATM` package to retain only CPS backscatter from the integrated Echoview data.

Echoes from fishes with swimbladders (blue points, scaled by backscatter intensity) along an example acoustic transect (top) and the corresponding echogram image (bottom). In this example, the upper (blue) and lower lines (green) indicate boundaries within which echoes were retained. When the lower boundary is deeper than the seabed (black line), echoes above the seabed are retained. Echoes from deep, bottom-dwelling schools of non-CPS fishes with swimbladders, and from diffuse scatters near the surface were excluded. The proximity of the echoes to the seabed was also used to define the lower limit for vertical integration.

In the plot window, you can now draw new integration stop (green) and start (blue) lines. Use the crosshair cursor to click along the plot to draw a new integration stop line, then right-click and select “Stop” to complete the line. Blue points that fall below this line will be excluded from the resulting CSV file. You want to remove backscatter that you believe are not CPS (e.g., rockfishes, hake) or possibly contain seabed. Next, draw a lnew top integration line (if desired) to remove any surface noise or diffuse scattering layers. If you say no to drawing this line, it will create a line at the surface and include all backscatter below. If you don’t like either line, you can respond “No” when it asks if the line looks good, and redraw the line. Rinse and repeat until you are satisfied.

Once you are happy with the two lines, an image will appear showing the results of your editing. If the backscatter needs to be removed, or put back, you can re-run the script and the results will be replaced.
