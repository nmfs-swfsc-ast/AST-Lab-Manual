title: "Set Up for Acoustic Trawl Surveys"
---

Set up for an acoustic trawl survey involved many moving pieces. This page serves as an orientation on all details related to mobilizing on vessels for acoustic trawl surveys.

**Survey Preparation Task List:**

-   [NOAA Ship Survey Equipment List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R30kuYmnvcmGABcBs5LVE5uG77VHtPi5/edit?gid=1393502436#gid=1393502436) - this Google Spreadsheet should be updated annually when preparing for survey mobilization

-   Work with ship to confirm ship transducers are cleaned before calibration

Below are links to pages inside this Quarto Website for setting up the acoustic systems on NOAA Ships and chartered fishing vessels to conduct CPS acoustic-trawl survey work.
