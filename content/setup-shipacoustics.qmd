When arriving to the ship, the following systems will need to be configured for Coastal Pelagic Species survey work. Each link goes to a Google document that will contain the latest procedures. Any updates and changes to configurations should be made inside the Google Document.

### Ship Acoustic System Orientation:

#### Kongsberg EK80 Scientific Echo Sounders

![EK80 transducer locations on the bottom of the centerboard aboard R/V Reuben Lasker.](images/transducers.jpg){#fig-transducers alt="Transducer locations on the bottom of the centerboard aboard Lasker." fig-align="left" width="551"}

On *Lasker* and *Shimada*, multi-frequency Wideband Transceivers (Simrad EK80 WBTs; Kongsberg) were confgured with split-beam transducers (Simrad ES18, ES38-7, ES70-7C, ES120-7C, ES200-7C, and ES333- 7C on *Lasker* and ES18, ES38B, ES70-7C, ES120-7C, and ES200-7C on *Shimada*; Kongsberg). The transducers were mounted on the bottom of a retractable keel or “centerboard” (@fig-transducers). The keel was retracted (transducers \~5-m depth) during calibration, and extended to the intermediate position (transducers \~7-m depth) during the survey. Exceptions were made during shallow water operations, when the keel was retracted; or during times of heavy weather, when the keel was extended (transducers \~9-m depth) to provide extra stability and reduce the efect of weather-generated noise. Transducer position and motion were measured at 5 Hz using an inertial motion unit (Applanix POS-MV; Trimble).

### **Ship Centerboard Drop Keel Depths**

Anytime that the ship changes the centerboard depth, the manual depth in the EK80 software should be updated accordingly:

| Reuben Lasker Centerboard Configuration | Manual Depth (meters) |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Retracted                               | 5.9 m                 |
| Intermediate                            | 7.35 m                |
| Extended                                | 9.1 m                 |

| Bell M. Shimada Centerboard Configuration | Manual Depth (meters) |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Retracted                                 | 6.1 m                 |
| Intermediate                              | 7 m                   |
| Extended                                  | 9.15 m                |
