# What is this resource? {.unnumbered}

The SWFSCâ€™s ATM surveys of CPS in the CCE began in 2006 with a focus on the northern stock of Pacific Sardine. Since then, they have expanded in scope and objectives to include the larger forage-fish assemblage and krill. This evolution, and the migratory behavior of Pacific Sardine, serve to explain the present survey region and design.
