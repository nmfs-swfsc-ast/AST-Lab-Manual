    "text": "Welcome\nLast updated: 2024-12-24 00:19:41 UTC\nWest Coast coastal pelagic species play an important role in the California Current ecosystem. They’re food sources for marine mammals, sea birds, and larger fish, and they support commercial and recreational fisheries (Zwolinski et al. 2014). Each year the NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center surveys the west coast from Baja Mexico to Vancouver Island, Canada to measure the biomass of 5 key coastal pelagic species: Pacific Sardine Sardinops sagax, Northern Anchovy Engraulis mordax, Pacific Mackerel Scomber japonicus, Jack Mackerel Trachurus symmetricus, Pacific Herring Clupea pallasii, and Round Herring Etrumeus acuminatus. The biomass and abundance estimates derived from the survey are used in stock assessment models to support sustainable fisheries.",

    "text": "Survey History:\nThe SWFSC’s ATM surveys of CPS in the CCE began in 2006 with a focus on the northern stock of Pacific Sardine. Quickly the annual surveys demonstrated valuable ecosystem insights. Since then, they have expanded in scope and objectives to include the larger forage-fish assemblage and krill. This evolution, and the migratory behavior of Pacific Sardine, serve to explain the present survey region and design.\n“Collectively, these annual or bi-annual ATM surveys provide a unique insight into the dynamics of forage fshes in the CCE, including their distributions, abundances, interactions, and environments. For example, results from 2006 through 2013 indicate that Pacifc Sardine dominated the CPS assemblage, but their biomass was declining (Demer and Zwolinski, 2012; Zwolinski and Demer, 2012) and their seasonal migration was contracting (Zwolinski et al., 2014). Meanwhile, harvest rates for the declining stock increased (Demer and Zwolinski, 2017), and the total forage-fsh biomass decreased to less than 200,000 t in 2014 and 2015 (Figs. 36, 37). The U.S. fshery for Pacifc Sardine was closed in 2015 (National Marine Fisheries Service, 2015), and there were reports of mass strandings, deaths, and reproductive failures in Brown Pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis3), Common Murres (Uria aalge), Brandt’s Cormorants (Phalacrocorax penicillatus), and California sea lions (Zalophus californianus4) (McClatchie et al., 2016), all of which depend on forage species. Since 2016, the forage-fsh biomass has increased, mainly due to resurgences of Jack Mackerel and the now dominant central stock of Northern Anchovy (Figs. 36, 37), whose biomass primarily (2,466,108 t, or 94% of the total estimate biomass) occurred in U.S. waters. Between the summers of 2018 and 2021, the biomass of the southern stock of Pacifc Sardine in U.S. waters has increased from 33,093 to 45,332 t.”(Stierhoff et al. 2024)",

The transducers were mounted on the bottom of a retractable keel or “centerboard” (Figure 2.1). The keel was retracted (transducers ~5-m depth) during calibration, and extended to the intermediate position (transducers ~7-m depth) during the survey. Exceptions were made during shallow water operations, when the keel was retracted; or during times of heavy weather, when the keel was extended (transducers ~9-m depth) to provide extra stability and reduce the efect of weather-generated noise. Transducer position and motion were measured at 5 Hz using an inertial motion unit (Applanix POS-MV; Trimble).\n\n\nUnderway CTD\nOn Lasker and Shimada, conductivity and temperature profiles were measured down to 300 m using calibrated sensors on a probe cast from the vessel while underway (UnderwayCTD, or UCTD; Teledyne Ocean- science). Casts were typically conducted between two to four times along each transect. These data indicate the depth of the surface mixed layer, above which most pelagic CPS reside during the day. These data were also used to estimate the time-averaged sound speed (Demer, 2004), for estimating ranges to the sound scatterers, and frequency-specific sound absorption coefficients, for compensating signal attenuation of the sound pulse between the transducer and scatterers (Simmonds and MacLennan, 2005).",

    "text": "After data aqusition, we identify acoustic echos of schooling CPS using a semi-automated data processing algorithm using Echoview software and in-house Posit code in the estimATM repository. With Echoview, we extract the backscatter of swim bladder fish and process using soundspeed and echosounder calibration values housed inside an Echoview Calibration Supplement (.ecs) file. The Echoview filters and thresholds were based on a sub-sample of echoes from randomly selected CPS schools. We complete the processing with the estimATM package in extract_CPS_NASC.R, where we further refine the backscatter selection to extract only CPS. Here we will cover the Echoview and estimATM semi-automated processing workflow.\n\nData Processing Overview\n\n\n\nOverview of CPS Acoustic Processing. Vessel position and attitude data is used from the POS MV (not shown).\n\n\n\n\n\nEchoview Processing Workflow\nIn Echoview, we organize, clean, and extract acoustic backscatter of swim bladder fish. There are three key steps to this process:\n\nData wrangling, cleaning, and noise removal (including surface noise and seabed removal)\nEcho classification for swim-bladdred fish\nAcoustic Backscatter Integration. The aim of the filter criteria is to retain at least 95% of the noise-free backscatter from CPS while rejecting at least 95% of the non-CPS backscatter.\n\n\n\n\nSimplified dataflow of processing in Echoview. *Surface noise and seabed removal replies on two manual inputs: the Integration Start and Integration Stop lines (not pictured, see step 5).\n\n\n\nSection 1) Data Wrangling, Cleaning, and Noise Removal:\n\nLoad RAW EK80 acoustic data and Echoview Calibration Supplement (.ecs)file into Echoview. The .ecs file contains soundspeed information calculated from the nearest (temporally and spatially) Underway CTD cast and echosounder calibration parameters. This file is used at the very beginning to convert from power to Sv (volume-backscattering coefficient).\nAlign sampling rate (time and geometery) from all transders to the 38 kHz Sv. Acousticians call this step ‘matching geometry’ of all Sv variables. Making sure pings are aligned from all echosounders is important for calculating the frequency response of backscatter in steps later on.\nRemove passive-mode pings.\nNoise removal: estimate and subtract background noise using the background noise removal function described in De Robertis and Higginbottom (2007).\nSurface noise and seabed removal is completed by manually drawing an Integration Start and Integration Stop line in Echoview. The Integration Start line is drawn at the shallowest depth to include surface CPS schools but exclude transducer ring down and surface noise due to sea state (typically around 5 meters below the transducer face or ~10m depth). The Integration Stop line is drawn closest to the seabed to include bottom dwelling animals but exclude any non-living seabed features (typically 3 m above the estimated seabed (Demer et al. 2009) or to the maximum logging range (e.g., 350 m), whichever is shallowest). When drawing the lines, we set the color scale to a minimum Sv threshold of -60 dB which corresponds to a density of approximately three 20-cm-long Pacific Sardine per 100 m3). Doing this helps visually pick out schools from the seabed and from non-swim bladder animals that appear as diffuse scattering layers in the water column. The area of the water column between the two lines sets the depth range that will be integrated for swim bladder fish in steps later on.\nAverage the noise-free Sv echograms using non-overlapping 11-sample by 3-ping bins.\nExpand the averaged, noise-reduced Sv echograms with a 7 pixel x 7 pixel dilation. This replaces each averaged datapoint from Step 6 with the maximum datapoint surrounding it in a 7x7 pixel region.\n\n\n\nSection 2) Echo Classification for Swim Bladder Fish\n\nCalculate Frequency Response:\n\nFor each dilated pixel, compute:\nSv 200kHz − Sv 38kHz\nSv 120kHz − Sv 38kHz\nSv 70kHz − Sv 38kHz\nThe difference between Sv values provides the frequency response for those pixels. Swim bladder fish have a unique frequency response which we can use extract those acoustic returns in the next step. Acoustic returns that fall within the Sv ranges below are flagged as meeting the criteria for typical swim bladder fish, including CPS.\nCreate a Boolean echogram for Sv differences in the CPS range:\n−13.85 &lt; Sv 70kHz − Sv 38kHz &lt; 9.89\n− 13.5 &lt; Sv 120kHz −Sv 38kHz &lt; 9.37\n− 13.51 &lt; Sv 200kHz − Sv 38kHz &lt; 12.53\n\n\n\nCalculate Standard Deviation:\n\nFor 120 and 200 kHz, compute the squared difference between the noise-filtered Sv (remove passive pings) and averaged Sv (11-sample x 3 ping bin averages).\nAverage the results using an 11-sample by 3-ping window to derive variance.\nCompute the square root to derive the 120- and 200-kHz standard deviations (σ120kHz and σ200kHz, respectively).\nExpand the standard deviation echograms with a 7 pixel x 7 pixel dilation (same step as Section 1, Step 7).\nCreate a Boolean echogram based on the standard deviations in the CPS range:\nσ120kHz &gt; -65 dB\nσ200kHz &gt; -65 dB\nDiffuse backscattering layers have low σ (Zwolinski et al. 2010) whereas fish schools have high σ. Intersect the two Boolean echograms to create an echogram with “TRUE” samples for candidate CPS schools and “FALSE” elsewhere. Mask the noise-reduced echograms using the CPS Boolean echogram .\n\n\n\n\nSection 3) Acoustic Backscatter Integration\n\nIntegrate the volume backscattering coefficients (sV , m2 m-3) attributed to CPS over 5-m depths and averaged over 100-m distances;\nOutput the resulting nautical area scattering coefficients (sA; m2 nmi-2) and associated information from each transect and frequency to comma-delimited text (.csv) files.\n\n\n\n\n\nPosit Processing Workflow\nThe exported .csv file from Echoview contains all swim bladder backscatter which can include non-target species such as rockfish. In order to further refine the acoustic classification to retain only CPS backscatter, the processed .csv file proceeds to the final semi-automated processing step in Posit using extract_CPS_NASC.R, an R-based tool in the estimATM package.\n\nEchoes from fishes with swimbladders (blue points, scaled by backscatter intensity) along an example acoustic transect (top) and the corresponding Echoview echogram image (bottom). In this example, the upper (blue) and lower lines (green) indicate boundaries within which echoes were retained. When the lower boundary is deeper than the seabed (black line), echoes above the seabed are retained. Echoes from deep, bottom-dwelling schools of non-CPS fishes with swimbladders, and from diffuse scatters near the surface are excluded.\nThe script will open a plot (top) where the acoustics technician can draw new integration start line (blue) and stop line (green). Blue points that fall below the stop line will be excluded while blue points below the start line will be included from the resulting .csv file. The goal is to visually review the Echoview exported echogram image (bottom) and remove backscatter that you believe are not CPS (e.g., rockfishes, hake), possibly contain accidental seabed, or any surface noise amd diffuse scattering layers. The process of picking out CPS from other swim-bladder fish can be tricky as CPS can have a range of characteristics. The Backscatter Identification section goes into detail on this process.\n\nOnce you are happy with the two lines, an image will appear showing the results of your editing. If the backscatter needs to be removed, or put back, you can re-run the script and the results will be replaced.\nThe result is a final .csv with only backscatter information for CPS targets.\n\n\n\n\nDe Robertis, Alex, and Ian Higginbottom. 2007. “A Post-Processing Technique to Estimate the Signal-to-Noise Ratio and Remove Echosounder Background Noise.” ICES Journal of Marine Science 64 (6): 1282–91. https://doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsm112.\n\n\nDemer, David A., George R.

    "text": "When performing the final step in CPS backscatter processing, there are several assumptions and acoustic characteristics about CPS that allow us to refine our classification. This process aims to distinguish CPS from non-target species from mid-water, demersal, and benthic swim bladder fishes.\n\n\nAcoustic Characteristics of CPS\nWhile the acoustic properties of swimbladder fish depends on several factors, the most important are the acoustic wavelength, swimbladder size, and swimbladder orientation to the incident sound pulse. We use 39, 70, 120, and 200kHz to capture a range of swimbladder sizes and orientations. We estimate the dorsal surface area of a swimbladder (swimbladder size) based on a function of fish lengths sampled from nightly trawl catches. Knowing the approximate dorsal surface area of a swimbladder allows us to calculate an acoustic backscattering coefficeint and derive a target strength for each CPS species. For this survey we calculate target strength as a logarithmic function of frequency and species-specific parameters obtained theoretically or experimentally and fish total length from trawl samples. Full details on species-specific target strength parameters can be found in the survey biomass report here.\nWhen looking at Echoview echograms of acoustic transects, visually we look for how the volume backscattering strength (Sv) changes over each frequency. We refer to this as the frequency response. Swimbladder fish are expected to have a flat or decreasing frequency response across 38kHz, 70kHz, 120kHz, and 200kHz (Figure 4.1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1\n\n\n\n\n\nBiological Characteristics of CPS\n\nTemperature ranges from 15 deg C and 17 deg C salinity from 30-38 psu (Zwolinski et al. 2010)\n\nCharacteristics of other swim bladder fish that are not CPS:\n\nDiffuse schools observed offshore near the surface or deeper than ~250m\nRockfish tend to be located in areas where the seabed is hard and rugged\n\nA picture guide for helping decipher tricky backscatter in the R script extract_CPS_NASC.R and Echoview processing.\n\nBuild out from this google document.\n\n\n\n\nZwolinski, Juan P., Paulo B.

    "text": "Acoustic transects are processed for CPS backscatter on the day of acquisition and used to determine nightly trawl locations. This page will walk through the process of trawl selection.\n\n1. Visual Comparison\nThe acoustics technician on watch completes a visual comparison between an in-house published map (plotSurvey) of backscatter results and the transect acoustic echogram. Dense schools of CPS seen in the echogram will correlate to colorful bubbles on plotSurvey.\n\nClicking on summarized acoustic points shows a popup that contains the time and distance interval over which those data were summarized, allowing you to scrutinize the results of Echoview processing. We make sure to cross-reference backscatter spots on plotSurvey with the exported image from Echoview to make an informed trawl-location decision.\n\n\n\n2. Best Judgement\nThe acoustics technician will select 2-3 trawls each night based on the backscatter observed during the daytime acoustic transect, operational efficiency, and expected CPS habitat. If no CPS backscatter is observed, trawl locations will default to using expected CPS habitat information and operational efficiency.\n\nExpected CPS habitat is derived from prior survey results and models:\n\nSardine habitat based on a 12-year data set of sardine eggs, remotely sensed oceanographic variables, sea surface temperature, chlorophyll a concentrations, sea surface altitude (Zwolinski, Emmett, and Demer 2011).\nCharted bathymetry – Pacific sardines can be found from the ocean surface to ~350m in depth and typically reside around smoother (less rocky) bottom types.\nSardine eggs are most abundant at sea-surface temperatures of 13 to 15 ∘C, and larvae are most abundant at 13 to 16 ∘C. Temperature is a primary driver of the spatial and seasonal distribution of spawning. During warm ocean conditions, sardine spawning shifts northward concentrating in offshore regions and north of Point Conception to San Francisco and in some years is observed as far north as Oregon (Kuriyama, Zwolinski, and Hill 2020).\n\n\n\n\n\nKuriyama, Peter T., Juan P.
